                                        <h5>The Value of Content: Re-writing for Redesigns</h5>
                                        <p>As the Government of Canada moves towards one website, writers, designers and developers are rethinking how Web content is presented across a plethora of devices. Jane Hazel, Director General of the Public Affairs Directorate at Health Canada, will share her experience moving from an organization-based website to a theme-based website. Learn from Health Canada’s example before your department undergoes a similar undertaking -- re-writing your content to create a streamlined, mobile-first and user-centric web presence on Canada.ca. </p>
                                        <h5>Bio</h5>
                                        <p>As Director General of the Public Affairs Directorate at Health Canada, Jane’s responsibilities include national social marketing plans and strategies, partnership development, public opinion research and consultation, leading on open government and overseeing the web presence for both Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. </p>
                                        <p>
Management of the Department’s web sites was centralized under communications and Healthy Canadians, the first themed web site bringing together content from multiple Departments, was launched several years ago.  A new Recalls and Safety Alerts database was created in the fall of 2012 and has built on the success of the Healthy Canadians web presence.  Through this centralization and theme-based approach to the site, Jane has led her team to effectively reduce web content to ensure a user-centric experience, and continually consults web metrics to drive the decision making process, all of which is critical to a successful web site.</p>
                                        <p>
With over 15 years of experience in public sector management, Jane’s focus on evidence-based decision making and marketing principles has contributed to the success of Health Canada in reaching Canadians with important health and safety information.</p>
