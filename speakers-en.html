                                            <p>Pirth Singh has a B. Eng. in Electrical Engineering and an MBA in Finance from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Over his fourteen years in the Government of Canada, Pirth has held positions in Policy Development, Business and Industry analysis and Information Technology at the Public Service Commission, Industry Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.</p> 
                                            <p>He currently serves as the Deputy Project Executive for the Web Renewal Initiative and leads the Web Standards Office at Treasury Board Secretariat, which has been the highlight of his career. Through Pirth’s commitment to building a community of collaboration within and outside of the Government of Canada, he has been a catalyst for changing the way policy is developed and the way departments come together to address common challenges. Under Pirth’s leadership, his small team took up the challenge to work collaboratively with hundreds of individuals across many departments and several private sector organizations to ensure websites and web applications are accessible, usable, interoperable and optimized for mobile. Some examples of these collaborative initiatives include the Web Experience Toolkit, open collaboration on GitHub, Standard on Web Usability and of course CodeFest.</p>
                                            <p>Pirth’s staff consider him their fearless leader, a great debater, mentor and a shining example of the leadership ideals required to make the public service an amazing place to work. Known for leaving his BlackBerry everywhere he goes, Pirth can most frequently be seen carrying a Starbucks coffee.</p>

                                        <h5>The Evolution: From Healthy Canadians to the Health Theme</h5>
                                            <p>As the Government of Canada moves towards one website, management, writers, designers and developers are rethinking how Web content is developed. Jane Hazel, Director General of the Public Affairs Directorate at Health Canada, will share her experience moving from an organization-based website to a theme-based website. Learn from Health Canada’s experience before your department re-positions its business model to create a streamlined, mobile-first and user-centric web presence on Canada.ca.</p>
                                        <h5>About Jane</h5>
                                            <p>As Director General of the Public Affairs Directorate at Health Canada, Jane’s responsibilities include national social marketing plans and strategies, partnership development, public opinion research and consultation, leading on open government and overseeing the web presence for both Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. </p>
                                            <p>Management of the Department’s web sites was centralized under communications and Healthy Canadians, the first themed web site bringing together content from multiple Departments, was launched several years ago.  A new Recalls and Safety Alerts database was created in the fall of 2012 and has built on the success of the Healthy Canadians web presence.  Through this centralization and theme-based approach to the site, Jane has led her team to effectively reduce web content to ensure a user-centric experience, and continually consults web metrics to drive the decision making process, all of which is critical to a successful web site.</p>
                                            <p>With over 15 years of experience in public sector management, Jane’s focus on evidence-based decision making and marketing principles has contributed to the success of Health Canada in reaching Canadians with important health and safety information.</p>
                                            <p>Jane holds an MBA from the University of Ottawa and a Bachelor’s of Science degree from McGill.</p>

How do we take these domains into consideration when creating virtual and physical retail experiences that are functional, beautiful, and above all useful? </p>
